# MusicDownloader

MusicDownloader allows you to download songs or entire playlists from Spotify, YouTube, and SoundCloud using a list of URLs. Whether you're downloading a single track or a full playlist, you can manage everything in one place.

Directions:
1. Enter the URLs for the songs or playlists from Spotify, YouTube, or SoundCloud.
1. For songs, you can download each track individually.
1. For playlists, you can download the songs in batches and select the batch size.
1. Use the Download All Songs button at the top to zip and download all tracks from the provided URLs at once.

_Note: There is a 2GB memory limit (roughly 250-400 songs). For longer playlists, load them separately to avoid exceeding the memory capacity._
